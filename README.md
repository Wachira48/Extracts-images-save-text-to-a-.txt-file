# Extracts-images-save-text-to-a-.txt-file

### Test the app
To test the app, we run the `python main.py`.

First, provide the tesseract path and hit enter:

```bash
> [!] Add the tesseract.exe local path
```

Once you hit enter, you will be instructed to add the PDF path:

```bash
> [!] Add the PDF file local path
```

On execution, the program creates an `output_txt` folder to save the extracted text information in `.txt` files.
